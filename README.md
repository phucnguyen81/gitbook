# Metaclasses

* Class creates object, `type` creates class
* Metaclass subclasses `type` to customize how class works
* Examples:
  * &#x20;`ABC` is a metaclass that checks abstract methods are implemented
  * We can write an Overload metaclass to allow method overloading
* NOTE: Python Metaclass is not Django Meta class, which provides metadata for the subclass without poluting its fields
